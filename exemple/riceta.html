<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>


<p><strong><u>This</u> recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</P>

<P>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</P>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
    175g of tahini<br>
    6 sundried tomatoes<br>
    Half a red pepper<br>
    A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
    1 clove of garlic<br>
    A dash of olive oil<br>
    </em>

    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>

chili pepper, lime and
